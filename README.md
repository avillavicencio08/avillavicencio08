# Hello, I am Antonio

He/him

I program as a hobby sometimes. Pretty much everything I've made here is because I thought it might be personally interesting and/or useful in the future. \
This is a business account, my personal account contains a lot more work. Most of my stuff on here is also private. \
I primarily use C, C++, Rust, etc, but I've been looking to branch out into Javascript, Typescript, and web stuff. \
I am experinced in Cybersecurity. I have Security+ and CCNA.

I support the use of FOSS, and primarily use GPLv3, LGPLv3, or MIT licenses for my projects.
